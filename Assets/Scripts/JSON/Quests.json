The new family has been successfully chased away from the house. While MacMaerny Estate Management is most displeased, the ghost has rewarded me for my valor. I return now to the Adventure Guild.",

Face to face with the bandit leader, I knew I had only one chance. I challenged him to a duel. He accepted, and we drew swords. We fought through the night, his dastardly men shouting and cheering all the while. As the sun peaked over the eastern hills, the bandit leader revealed a moment of weakness and I struck. He fell, his face marked eternally with an expression of shock. His band of brutes scattered immediately and in their confusion ran directly into a patrol passing on the nearby highway. I reported the defeat of the bandit gang to the villagers and received my rewrad. I now return to the Adventure Guild.",
