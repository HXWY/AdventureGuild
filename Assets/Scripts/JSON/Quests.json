The new family has been successfully chased away from the house. While MacMaerny Estate Management is most displeased, the ghost has rewarded me for my valor. I return now to the Adventure Guild.",

We fought through the night, his dastardly men shouting and cheering all the while. As the sun peaked over the eastern hills, the bandit leader revealed a moment of weakness and I struck. He fell, his face marked eternally with an expression of shock. His band of brutes scattered immediately and in their confusion ran directly into a patrol passing on the nearby highway.

Fyrheort screamed at the students to continue to slam me regardless of my condition. Luckily, another headmage heard the commotion and brought an end to the chaos. As I was carried out in a daze I heard Fyrheort lecturing on urgency and hesitation in battle. The other head-mages settled my payment and I returned to the Adventure Guild.",

I entered the silent, inky black passage and emerged in a narrow hall, ornate pedestals standing at either end. Upon each sat a skull atop a tome of undecipherable scribblings. A grey figure appeared before me, not standing but suspended as a man-sized puppet. Seeming at first to be dead, its eyes suddenly sprung open in rage and two imps of the wizard attacked! I fought off the imps, finally lunging forth to bury my blade in the heart of the dark wizard. In a panic the imps disappeared into a magic circle, presumably returning to the plane from whence they came. The lair was silent once more, but calm and peaceful. I collected the ingredients for the gnomes and completed my quest. I now return to the Adventure Guild.",
